## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_square.JPG" height=200>

Hi, I am a PhD researcher at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford.

## Research Interest

My work focuses on using deep learning and statistical methods to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and resolution of large-scale coastal hazard predictions. My main project involves building generative models trained on climate reanalysis data to sample spatially coherent multivariate climate extremes.

I am also interested in large-scale infrastructure resilience to climate hazards and have worked on a number of national-scale climate resilience assessments with Oxford Infrastructure Analytics (OIA), the World Bank, and UNOPS.
